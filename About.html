        <h2>Dr. Anne Anderson (1906-1907)</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Anne Anderson was an author and teacher who was instrumental in preserving the cree language and promoting
            Métis
            heritage in Alberta and Canada.
            <br>
            Anderson was in her 60s when she started writing more than 90 books about the cree language and Métis
            history,
            traditions, herbal remedies and recipes.
            <br>
            Anderson was one of 10 children who grew up on a farm near St. Albert with a cree mother and Métis-Scottish
            father.
            She was forced to speak English in school, but her mother taught her about cree culture and urged her to
            speak the
            language at home.
            <br>
            After Anderson’s father died when she was a teenager, she went to work to help support her family. She
            eventually moved
            to Edmonton during the 1940s to work as a nurse’s aide.
            <br>
            Anderson has said during media interviews that a deathbed request from her mother prompted her to start
            writing about
            her culture and language. Before Anderson’s mother died, she urged Anderson to preserve the cree language,
            which was
            threatened with extinction by the history of residential schools and policies that promoted assimilation.
            <br>
            After Anderson left nursing, she began writing books, including a cree dictionary she worked on with help
            from her
            niece. She also recorded cree language tapes to preserve the sounds of the language.
            <br>
            In the early 1980s, she established the Dr. Anne Anderson Native Heritage and Cultural Centre, which offered
            cree
            language courses for children and adults as well as a library and other resources. Anderson’s extensive
            collection
            of artifacts and books was later preserved by the Métis Nation of Alberta.
            <br>
            Anderson helped introduce cree classes to schools in Alberta and across Canada, and taught at many
            post-secondary
            schools, including the University of Alberta. Her work has been recognized with numerous awards including an
            Alberta
            Achievement Award, the Order of Canada and an honorary doctorate from the University of Alberta. She was
            also named
            one of the 100 Edmontonians of the Century.

        <p>
            As members of the Dr. Anne Anderson High School Community, we are filled with gratitude as we honour Treaty
            6 Territory,
            a traditional meeting place to the cree, Metis, Blackfoot, Dene, Nakota Sioux, Saulteaux, and Inuit. Our
            inherent
            responsibility to safeguard and preserve the Earth stems from the First Nations’ relationship to the land.
            Today,
            and all days, we acknowledge our shared history and the work we must do collectively to make the future a
            better
            place for all in our journey of reconciliation.
